# Adaptive Spreading Factor Selection (ASFS) for SX126x LoRa Transceiver üì°

## Description

This project implements an Adaptive Spreading Factor Selection (ASFS) algorithm for the SX126x LoRa transceiver. The ASFS algorithm dynamically adjusts the spreading factor (SF) based on channel activity, optimizing communication performance in LoRa networks. The implementation is tailored for the SX1261MB2BAS shield and the STM32 Nucleo L476RG microcontroller.

## Adaptive Spreading Factor Selection (ASFS) üîç

### Context and Importance

In a LoRa Mesh Network, nodes communicate using different Spreading Factors (SFs), which determine the data transmission rate and signal range. Each SF corresponds to a distinct symbol duration, directly affecting the time needed to detect the preamble (initial synchronization sequence) during message reception.

When multiple clusters use different SFs, a node belonging to multiple clusters must be able to receive messages on various channels. This complicates synchronization, as the node needs to detect and align with the SF used by each transmitter within a limited time. Efficient detection and alignment are crucial for maintaining reliable communication.


### Problem to Address

The main challenge is to minimize the time required to detect the SF used by a transmitter, as the receiver must inspect several possible SFs before synchronizing with the correct one. The order in which SFs are inspected significantly affects the total detection time (CAD time). Inefficient inspection can lead to delays or communication failures if the preamble is not detected in time.

### ASFS Algorithm üß©

To improve SF detection speed and reliability, the ASFS algorithm dynamically adjusts the inspection order of SFs based on network conditions and the node's communication history. The key steps are:

![Example Image](image\Algorithme de s√©lection SF. (1).png)

1. **Iterative Inspection**: The receiver inspects each SF multiple times during preamble reception. This approach reduces false detection chances but increases detection time.
2. **Probability-Based Selection**: If an SF is consistently detected across multiple iterations, it is selected for synchronization. If a lower SF (SF7 or SF8) is detected, inspection is stopped early, as the probability of false detection is negligible at these levels.
3. **Conditional Detection for SF9 to SF12**: For higher SFs (SF9 to SF12), the algorithm continues inspection until a neighboring SF fails to detect the preamble. This confirms the SF with increased confidence, even in noisy or high-interference environments.

### Benefits of ASFS üåü

The ASFS algorithm significantly reduces SF detection time while enhancing communication reliability. Although it is more complex to implement, its performance benefits make it preferable, especially in scenarios where nodes must communicate with multiple clusters using different SFs.
